    <h2>...and my new Astro site!</h2>
    
        <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> page, and it's the 1<sup>st</sup> one I built myself!</p>
        <p>This site will update as I continue the tutorial, so check back to see my progress!</p>

        <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My name is {identity.firstname}.</li>
            <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
            {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && 
            <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}.</li>
            }
        </ul>

        <p>My skills are:</p>
        <ul>
            {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
        </ul>
